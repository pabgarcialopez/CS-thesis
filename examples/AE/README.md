We include several examples of reconstructed audios made by our autoencoder with different model configurations.

Additionally, please note that the file ejXr.wav represents the reconstructed version of the audio ejX.wav, where X is simply a number corresponding to the folder or example.

Each folder has been named accoring to each row of a results table from our thesis. For more information, refer to Chapter 5 of our thesis.
