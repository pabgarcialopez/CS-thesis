# Learning Latent Representations of Timbre Using Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders

This repository accompanies the thesis project focused on learning compact and meaningful representations of **timbre** using **Autoencoders (AEs)** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**.

We implemented and trained these models on audio data to analyze and visualize how neural networks can encode timbral features in a low-dimensional latent space.

For a complete overview, please refer to the thesis PDF included in the repository.
